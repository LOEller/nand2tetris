# Nand2Tetris Project Repository

Welcome to my **Nand2Tetris** project repository! This repository contains my implementations and projects as part of the [Nand2Tetris course](https://www.nand2tetris.org/), which builds a computer from scratch, starting with basic logic gates and culminating in a fully functional computer system capable of running simple programs.

## ðŸš€ About the Project

The Nand2Tetris course explores the inner workings of a computer by guiding participants through:

- Building a computer chip from first principles.
- Developing an assembler, virtual machine, and compiler.
- Writing simple high-level programs that execute on the system.
- Understanding the interplay between hardware and software layers.

This repository documents my journey through the course, including custom-built hardware modules, assembly language programs, and the culminating projects.
